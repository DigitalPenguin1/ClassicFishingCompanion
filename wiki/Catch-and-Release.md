# Catch & Release

Catch & Release lets you mark specific fish for automatic deletion. When you catch one, press your Release Fish keybind to delete it from your bags — the catch still counts toward your statistics.

Useful for keeping bags clean when farming a specific fish and don't want to loot unwanted species.

## Setup

The Release Fish keybind must be set up once before use:

1. Press **ESC** > **Settings** > **Key Bindings**
2. Scroll down to **Classic Fishing Companion**
3. Bind a key to **Release Fish**
4. **Fully restart WoW** — a `/reload` is not enough for new keybinds to take effect

---

## Adding Fish to the Release List

1. Open CFC (`/cfc`) > **Release** tab
2. Select a fish from the dropdown
3. Click **Add**

The fish appears in your release list. You can add as many as you like.

---

## Using Catch & Release While Fishing

1. Catch a fish that is on your release list
2. CFC will notify you in chat that the fish is ready to release
3. Press your **Release Fish keybind** — the fish is deleted from your bags

> The catch is still recorded in your statistics and counts toward goals.

---

## Removing Fish from the Release List

Select the fish in the list and click **Remove**, or click **Clear All** to remove everything.

---

## Notes

- The keybind must be pressed manually — CFC cannot auto-delete items due to WoW security restrictions on protected actions
- A full client restart is required after setting the keybind for the first time
- If the keybind doesn't work, double-check it's bound in Key Bindings and that you restarted the client
