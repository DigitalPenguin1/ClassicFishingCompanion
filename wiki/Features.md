# Features

A full breakdown of everything Classic Fishing Companion does.

---

## Stats HUD

A draggable on-screen overlay that shows real-time fishing stats while you fish.

**Displays:**
- Session catches and total all-time catches
- Fish per hour (current session)
- Current fishing skill
- Active lure name and time remaining
- Up to 3 active Goals with color-coded progress

**Controls:**

- Click and drag to reposition it anywhere on screen
- Toggle between bordered and minimal style in Settings

See [[HUD]] for full details.

## Easy Cast

Double right-click your fishing bobber to cast. CFC also automatically applies your selected lure when it expires — no manual re-applying needed.

See [[Easy Cast and Lures]] for full details.

---

## Gear Sets

Save your fishing and combat equipment as named gear sets. CFC can automatically swap you to combat gear when you're attacked and back to fishing gear when combat ends.

See [[Gear Sets]] for full details.

---

## Catch List

A complete history of everything you've caught, separated into **Fish** and **Miscellaneous** categories.

**Shows:**
- Item icon, name, and total count
- Percentage of total catches
- Best hour of day to catch that fish

---

## Zones Tab

A collapsible zone-based view of your catch history.

**Shows:**
- Every zone you've fished in
- All fish caught per zone with icons and counts
- Zone stats: total fish, unique species, % of all catches
- Best hour tooltip per fish

---

## Statistics Tab

A summary of your overall fishing stats.

**Shows:**
- Total catches (all-time and session)
- Fish per hour
- Top fish by count
- Zone productivity comparison

---

## Lure Manager

Select your preferred lure from a dropdown in the HUD. CFC will apply it automatically when it expires if Easy Cast is enabled.

See [[Easy Cast and Lures]] for the full supported lure list.

---

## Goals

Set session-based catch goals for specific fish. Goals reset each login or `/reload` so you can set fresh targets every time you fish.

- Up to 3 goals display on the HUD with progress bars
- Color-coded: yellow at 75%, green when complete
- Completion triggers a sound and chat notification

See [[Goals]] for full details.

---

## Catch & Release

Mark specific fish for automatic deletion. When you catch one, press your Release Fish keybind to delete it from your bags — the catch still counts toward your stats.

See [[Catch and Release]] for setup and usage.

---

## Alerts & Notifications

- **Rare fish sound** — plays when you catch a rare fish
- **Milestone notifications** — celebrate catch milestones in chat
- **Missing lure warning** — on-screen alert when fishing without a lure
- **Out-of-lure message** — chat warning when Easy Cast can't apply a lure (once per 10 min)

---

Bind keys to CFC actions via **ESC > Settings > Key Bindings > Classic Fishing Companion**.

## Minimap Button

- **Left-click** — open/close the main UI

---

## Data Backup

CFC automatically backs up your fishing data every 24 hours. You can restore a backup from the Settings tab at any time.

---

## Per-Character Mode

By default, stats are shared account-wide. Enable Per-Character Mode in Settings to track stats separately per character, with the option to copy account data to a character.
