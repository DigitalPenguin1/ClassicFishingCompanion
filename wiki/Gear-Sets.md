# Gear Sets

Gear Sets let you save your fishing and combat equipment so CFC can swap between them automatically.

## Saving Gear Sets

**From the UI:**
1. Equip your fishing gear (pole, hat, lure, etc.)
2. Open CFC > **Gear Sets** tab
3. Click **Save Fishing Set**
4. Repeat with your combat gear and click **Save Combat Set**

**From chat:**
```
/cfc savefishing   — saves current gear as your fishing set
/cfc savecombat    — saves current gear as your combat set
```

## Swapping Gear

**Manually:**
```
/cfc swap   — toggles between fishing and combat gear
```

Or assign a keybind in Key Bindings (see [[Keybindings]]).

**Right-clicking the minimap button** also swaps gear and toggles the HUD at the same time.

## Auto-Swap on Combat

When enabled, CFC automatically swaps to your combat gear when you're attacked.

**Behavior:**
- If you are **not actively casting** when combat starts — swaps instantly
- If you **are casting** — a button appears on-screen to click when you're ready to swap
- When combat ends — swaps back to your fishing gear automatically

**To enable:**
1. Open CFC > **Settings** tab
2. Enable **Auto-Swap Combat Weapons**

## Tips

- Include your fishing pole, fishing hat, and any stat gear in your fishing set for maximum skill
- Include your best weapon and off-hand in your combat set so you're ready to fight
- If the swap button doesn't appear during combat, check that both gear sets have been saved
