# Goals

The Goals tab lets you set session-based catch targets for specific fish, with live progress tracking on the HUD.

---

## Setting a Goal

1. Open CFC (`/cfc`) > **Goals** tab
2. Select a fish from the dropdown (only fish you've caught before appear)
3. Enter a target count
4. Click **Add Goal**

The goal appears in the list and immediately shows on the HUD if you have fewer than 3 active goals.

---

## HUD Display

Up to **3 goals** are shown on the HUD at once, each displaying:
- Fish icon
- Fish name
- Current progress (e.g. `4 / 20`)

**Progress colors:**
| Color | Meaning |
|---|---|
| White | In progress (under 75%) |
| Yellow | Getting close (75%+) |
| Green | Complete! |

---

## Completion

When you reach your target count:
- The progress bar turns **green**
- A **sound plays**
- A **chat message** congratulates you

---

## Session Reset

Goals reset every time you log in or do a `/reload`. This is intentional — goals are designed as per-session targets so you can set fresh ones each time you fish.

> Your overall catch history and statistics are never reset by goals.

---

## Removing a Goal

Select the goal in the list and click **Remove**, or click **Clear All** to remove all goals at once.
