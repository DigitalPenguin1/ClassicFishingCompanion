# Keybindings

CFC adds a dedicated section to WoW's Key Bindings menu with bindable actions.

---

## Available Keybinds

| Keybind | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Toggle Fishing UI** | Opens or closes the main CFC window |
| **Toggle Fishing HUD** | Shows or hides the Stats HUD (also swaps gear if enabled) |
| **Release Fish** | Deletes the pending Catch & Release fish from your bags |

---

## How to Set Up

1. Press **ESC** > **Settings** > **Key Bindings**
2. Scroll down to the **Classic Fishing Companion** section
3. Click the keybind slot next to the action you want to bind
4. Press your desired key
5. Click **Okay**

> **Important:** After setting a keybind for the first time, you must **fully restart WoW** — a `/reload` alone is not enough. This is a WoW limitation for new keybind categories.

---

## Notes

- Subsequent keybind changes (after the first restart) only require a `/reload`
- The Release Fish keybind requires a hardware event (actual keypress) to work — it cannot be triggered by macros or scripts due to WoW security restrictions
